# JAVA_Calculator-Flipper-Sorter
Calculator, Coin Flipper and Data Sorter
I created a program that gives you a few different options to choose from. You can either use a calculator, play a coin flipping game, or sort some data. For the calculator, you just need to type in two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) and it will calculate the result for you. For the coin flipping game, you choose either heads or tails by typing 'H' or 'T', and then it will randomly generate the outcome. If you guess correctly, it will say "Good Job!" and if you don't, it will say "Sorry". For the data sorting option, you'll be prompted to enter the titles and values for three sets of data. Then it will sort the data based on the titles and display the values in order. You can keep using the program as long as you want, or you can choose to exit when you're done. I wanted to create a fun little project so I hope anyone that finds this gets some enjoyment out of it.
